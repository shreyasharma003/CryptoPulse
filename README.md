Cryptocurrency Price Predictor

This project is a web-based platform for predicting cryptocurrency prices using historical data and machine learning models. It aims to provide users with insights into future price trends for popular cryptocurrencies, helping traders, investors, and enthusiasts make informed decisions.

The platform is being developed in multiple milestones, with the current focus on data collection and preparation for model training.

Project Overview

The Cryptocurrency Price Predictor website is designed to:

Collect historical price data for multiple cryptocurrencies.

Analyze trends and patterns in cryptocurrency prices.

Predict future prices using machine learning algorithms.

Provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to explore predictions.

The project currently supports eight cryptocurrencies, and the backend is being structured to allow smooth integration with machine learning models in the next milestones.

Milestone 1: Data Collection and Preparation

In the first milestone of this project, we focused on gathering and organizing historical price data for eight cryptocurrencies. This phase includes:

Data Collection:
Historical price data for eight popular cryptocurrencies was collected from reliable sources. The dataset includes daily open, close, high, low prices, and trading volume.

Data Organization:
Each cryptocurrency has been stored in a separate CSV file, making it easier to manage and use for model training.

Preparation for Model Training:
The collected and structured data is now ready for the next phase, which involves training machine learning models for price prediction.

This milestone lays the foundation for building a robust prediction model in subsequent phases of the project.
